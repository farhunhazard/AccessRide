## Enabling Accessible Transportation for Those with Disabilities

AccessRide is a cutting-edge website created to transform the transportation experience for those with impairments. We want to offer a welcoming, trustworthy, and accommodating ride-hailing service that is suited to the particular requirements of people with mobility disabilities since we are aware of the special obstacles they encounter.

Our goal is to close the accessibility gap in the transportation industry and guarantee that everyone has access to safe and practical travel alternatives. We link passengers with disabilities to skilled, sympathetic drivers who have been educated to offer specialised assistance and fulfil their particular needs using the AccessRide app.

## Accessibility:-

The app focuses on ensuring accessibility for passengers with
disabilities by offering vehicles equipped with wheelchair
ramps or lifts, spacious interiors, and other necessary
accessibility features.

## Specialized Drivers:-

The app recruits drivers who are trained to provide assistance
and support to passengers with disabilities. These drivers are
knowledgeable about accessibility requirements and are
committed to delivering a comfortable experience.

## Customized Preferences:-

Passengers can specify their particular needs and preferences
within the app, such as requiring a wheelchair-accessible
vehicle, additional time for boarding and alighting, or any
specific assistance required during the ride.

## Real-time Tracking:-

Passengers can track the location of their assigned vehicle in
real-time, providing peace of mind and ensuring they are
prepared for pick-up

## Safety Measures:-

The app prioritizes passenger safety by conducting driver
background checks, ensuring proper vehicle maintenance,
and implementing safety protocols to enhance the overall
travel experience.

## Seamless Payment:-
The app offers convenient and secure payment options,
allowing passengers to complete their transactions
electronically, reducing the need for physical cash handling

## ML Algorithms:-
We have used ML algorithms to estimate the appropriate driver for the passenger.

## Location-Based Services(LBS)
Location-based services plays a crucial role in matching passengers with nearby drivers to serve disabled passengers.

In conclusion,<b>AccessRide</b> is an innovative and groundbreaking project that aims to transform the transportation experience for people with disabilities. By focusing on accessibility, specialized driver training, and a machine learning algorithm, the app sets itself apart from traditional ride-hailing services.
